meta-unify
==========

This is a yocto layer which holds recipes for the UNIFY project:
https://www.fp7-unify.eu/

It is supposed to be added onto a CarOS build-host,
which usually means you have the following additional
layers: poky, meta-caros, meta-virtualization and some layers 
of meta-openembedded.
